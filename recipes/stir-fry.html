    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups water</li>
        <li>2 cups white rice</li>
        <li>2/3 cups soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon red chilli flakes</li>
        <li>3 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 head broccoli, broken into florets</li>
        <li>1 onion, cut up in large chunks</li>
        <li>1 cup sliced carrots</li>
        <li>1 green bell pepper, cut up</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil rice in water at high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer rice until fluffy, and water has been absorbed, for 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>While rice is boiling, combine soy sauce, brown sugar, and cornstarch in a bowl. Stir in ginger, garlic, and chili flakes. Add chicken and mix well. Cover and refrigerate for at least 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add 1 tablespoon of oil to a skillet at medium-high heat, and add the vegetables. Cook and stir them until tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a dish and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining tablespoon of oil in the same skillet at medium-high heat, and add the chicken with some marinade. Cook the chicken until just browned, for 2 minutes per side. Stir in the vegetables and add the remaining marinade. Cook the chicken until it's not pink inside and vegetables are tender, for 5 to 7 minutes. Serve it over rice.</li>
    </ol>
